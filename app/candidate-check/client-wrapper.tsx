// This file is not directly used by CandidateCheckClientPage.tsx in the current implementation,
// as CandidateCheckClientPage is already a client component.
// If there was a need to wrap a server component with a client component for interactivity,
// this file would serve that purpose.

// Example structure if it were used:
// "use client";
// import CandidateCheckClientPage from "./CandidateCheckClientPage";

// export default function ClientWrapper() {
//   return <CandidateCheckClientPage />;
// }
