Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) Policy 
EWA Tracker Ltd 
1. Policy Review Status 
This	policy	was	reviewed	in	July	2025	and	will	be	reviewed	annually	or	upon	changes	to 
awarding	body	or	regulatory	guidance.	Next	review	due:	July	2026. 
2. Purpose 
The	purpose	of	this	policy	is	to	ensure	that	learners'	prior	learning	and	achievements	are 
formally	recognised	where	appropriate,	thereby	avoiding	duplication	of	learning	and 
enabling	efficient	progression	through	their	qualification. 
3. Communication, Training and CPD 
This	policy	is	communicated	to	all	assessors	and	quality	assurance	staff	during	induction 
and	updated	through	CPD.	All	delivery	staff	are	expected	to	be	familiar	with	the	RPL	process 
and	apply	it	appropriately. 
4. Definitions of RPL and Subcategories 
Recognition	of	Prior	Learning	(RPL)	is	the	process	of	using	evidence	of	a	learner's	previous 
non-certificated	achievements	to	demonstrate	competence	within	a	qualification. 
Subcategories	of	RPL	include: 
-	Prior	experiential	learning	(e.g.,	work	experience) 
-	Prior	formal	learning	(e.g.,	previous	qualifications	or	training) 
-	Informal	learning	(e.g.,	self-taught	skills) 
5. RPL Procedure 
1.	Learner	expresses	interest	in	RPL	during	initial	assessment	or	induction. 
2.	Assessor	reviews	available	evidence	(e.g.,	portfolios,	references,	past	qualifications). 
3.	A	mapping	exercise	is	conducted	to	match	evidence	against	unit	criteria. 
4.	If	evidence	is	sufficient,	valid,	and	current,	credit	is	awarded	through	RPL. 
5.	Records	of	decisions	and	rationale	are	kept	in	the	learner's	portfolio. 
6.	RPL	decisions	are	subject	to	internal	quality	assurance	and	may	be	externally	verified.
